# Prompts Used

## Insights Prompt

Can you take a look at the following document and identify three key trends or concerns that might need to be identified or addressed? It can be anything from productivity concerns to cost to of certain toys or categories vs demand. It would be used for a carousel on a dashboard as the client has told us they find all of the charts to be overwhelming so the trends should be easy to understand. 

The format should provided in straight text - we'll be using a reindeer to provide the insights. An example of a insight might be: 

"Plushies are a very popular item but requires a more Elves than most other categories and are one of the higher cost per item toys this year."

Each Insight should touch on something different but ultimately be the most important things the client should know about.



## Reindeer Prompt

Can you create an adorable cartoon reindeer with antlers, a red nose, a Christmas Hat and and a scarf. It should be a full body shot which will be used to provide insights on a dashboard. It should be on a white background.


## Carousel Prompt

Can you create a new component that acts as a carousel. It should follow the design provided. Please ensure it's responsive and it should be the first component on the dashboard. Here's the CSS code from Figma for styling guidelines. Can you also please add some holiday flair to align with the other components aready on the dashboard.

The three slides should be of the following content:

	1.	“Electronics are the most expensive toys to produce, averaging the highest cost per item at $56.84. While popular, their high price may affect overall profitability.”
	2.	“Wooden Toys require the most elves, totaling 1,011 across all projects. Consider balancing resources to meet demand without overburdening this category.”
	3.	“Plushies take the most production time, with 6,508 total hours, significantly outpacing other categories. Streamlining production could help increase efficiency.”
